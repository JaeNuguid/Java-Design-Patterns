Strategy Design Pattern allows the algorithm to vary independently from clients that use it. It helps on designing a flexible and reusable object-oriented software.
<br/>
The ability to store and retrieve a reference to some code in a data structure is the fundamental prerequisite in order to implement Strategy Design Pattern. This is achievable by mechanisms as the native function pointer, the first-class function, classes or class instances in object-oriented programming languages, or accessing the language implementation's internal storage of code through reflection.

## Observer Design Pattern<a id="odp"></a>

The observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, called the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.
<br/>
In the example that we have, LottoGame is the subject, while Players are the dependents. When LottoGame draws/rolls, it notifies all the Players, and then the Players fetch the result from LottoGame.
<br/>
Observer pattern is used when there is one-to-many relationship between objects such as if one object is modified, its depenedent objects are to be notified automatically. Observer pattern falls under behavioral pattern category.
