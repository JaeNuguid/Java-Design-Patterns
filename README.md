Strategy Design Pattern allows the algorithm to vary independently from clients that use it. It helps on designing a flexible and reusable object-oriented software.
<br/>
The ability to store and retrieve a reference to some code in a data structure is the fundamental prerequisite in order to implement Strategy Design Pattern. This is achievable by mechanisms as the native function pointer, the first-class function, classes or class instances in object-oriented programming languages, or accessing the language implementation's internal storage of code through reflection.
